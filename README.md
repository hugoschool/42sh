##  **Git configuration**

For this project, we will use a corporate like Git repo with branches, each branches will have it's purpose.

* Main: Where the mouli will execute the code, only merge within DO NOT PUSH
* Dev: Where we implement features, we can push here but it is more likely convinient to create a branch for every feature we implement and to merge it in the DEV
* Test: where we develop test, to merge with dev to check everything before pushing to main

In case of breaking something in main branch, DO NOT PUSH, create branch hotfix and then merge it (because in the hotfix you can commit instead of the man branch)  
This also apply for the main branch  

If you need help with git : [Git course by me](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGgfwSCgPc/goCja-JEPHb2s3MRiMo2ow/edit?utm_content=DAGgfwSCgPc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)  
Or just ask me
