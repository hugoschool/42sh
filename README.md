##  **Git configuration**

For this project, we will use a corporate like Git repo with branches, each branches will have it's purpose.

* Main: Where the mouli will execute the code, only merge within DO NOT PUSH
* Test: where we develop test, to merge with dev to check everything before pushing to main
* [feature]: everyone will dev his own feature and merge it using a pull request

In case of breaking something in main branch, DO NOT PUSH, create branch hotfix and then merge it (because in the hotfix you can commit instead of the man branch)  
This also apply for the main branch

If you need help with git : [Git course by me](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGgfwSCgPc/goCja-JEPHb2s3MRiMo2ow/edit?utm_content=DAGgfwSCgPc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
